#Open Science/Open Research 101

Open science is a different approach to the practice of scientific research, aimed at making research more understandable, useful, and impactful. When you’re doing open science you:

* **Clearly document all research methods, processes, observations, code, and data;  make these freely, publicly available for reuse and redistribution**

* **Collaborate with researchers from within your discipline and across disciplines, often via the world wide web**

* **Make research communications widely available and accessible to the public, encouraging public engagement and participation in research.**

These open practices are not just specific to science-- in fact, they are applicable to any kind of research! The next several sections introduce and explore Open Science concepts and practices in more detail.
